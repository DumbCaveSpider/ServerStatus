# Servers Status
Display the server and internet connection status in-game! It checks if <cg>Geode</c>, <cg>Boomlings</c>, and your <cg>Internet Connection</c> are up or down, and displays the icon status as well as a popup with more information.

The following colors are used to indicate the status:
- <cg>Green: All services are up</c>
- <co>Orange: One or more services are down</c>
- <cr>Red: All services are down</c>

<cy>You can customize the Internet Icon Status in the mod settings!</cy>

<cr>If you encounter a popup showing behind the menu with this mod, install [To the top! by Alphalaneous](id:alphalaneous.to_the_top) as it might fix the issue.</c>
<cr>*For technical reason: keepAcrossScenes is used to keep the icon across scenes, but using this function causes getHighestChildZ to break. This is something that I cannot fix.*</c>
